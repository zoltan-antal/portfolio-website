    <p>
      Originally from Hungary, I moved to the UK in 2015 and graduated with a
      Master&apos;s in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Sheffield in
      2020. My interest in coding, sparked during my school years, grew
      significantly whilst working as an engineer, where I found myself
      increasingly involved in programming tasks. This rekindled passion for
      programming ultimately led me to change career to become a software
      developer.

      In 2022, I began studying full-time following the computer science
      curriculum of the Open Source Society University. This included courses in
      algorithms & data structures, computer architecture, programming
      languages, and other key subjects, offered by Harvard, MIT and other
      renowned universities. In 2023, I chose to specialise in full-stack web
      development, completing the Full Stack Open programme of the University of
      Helsinki and immersing myself in JavaScript and various backend, frontend
      and database technologies.

      In my free time I enjoy tackling coding challenges in Python, but beyond
      programming my hobbies include ballroom dancing, wildlife photography,
      hiking, wood carving and playing board games & video games.
